      A Degas self-portrait painted in 1855, when Degas was 21. 


      Degas' Suffering of New Orleans, typical of the historical paintings
      produced by the artist in his early career. Degas' Spartan Girls
      Challenging Boys, one of the most famous works of his early career.


      Edgar Degas was born on 19 July 1834 at 8, Rue Saint Georges in Paris. He
      was the eldest of his parents' five children Degas’ father, Augustin, was
      a wealthy banker and his mother a Creole emigre from New Orleans. Degas
      attended a good Lycee and graduated with a baccalaureate in 1853. He then
      studied law for a while, but it became increasingly clear that art was his
      true vocation.


      Unlike Monet, Degas’ father was a source of encouragement and advice.
      Degas enrolled at the Louvre as a copyist and spent large chunks of the
      1850s in Italy, staying in Florence and Rome in particular, copying
      Renaissance masterpieces.


      ### Degas’ early style


      Degas’ early style might be said to be classical, and it is certainly true
      that he was inspired by Ingres and old masters such as Titian. But two
      aspects of Degas’ work suggested from an early age that he was destined
      for greatness.


      First, Degas was a hard-worker. By 1860, he has produced 700 copies of
      older works.


      Secondly, and more importantly, Degas did not copy works unthinkingly. He
      would, for example, focus on a small part of a masterpiece rather than
      seek to reproduce the whole. And Degas committed his thinking on painting,
      together with many of his innermost thoughts, to a meticulous diary.


      ### Degas’ early works


      Degas’ unique insight can be seen in three of his earliest works, The
      Suffering of New Orleans, Spartan Girls Challenging Boys and The Bellelli
      Family.


      (1) The Suffering of New Orleans is ostensibly an historical painting in
      classical style. But it seeks to depict a modern event, the capture of New
      Orleans by Union Troops in 1862 (representing a major turning-point in the
      American Civil War).

**Edgar Degas was born in Paris in 1834, his father a wealthy banker and his mother an emigre from New Orleans.**

Despite his privileged upbringing, Degas was a difficult person. He was opinionated, demanding and (at least in later life) anti-Semitic. As Caillebotte said during preparations for one of the impressionist exhibitions,

“He is quite intolerable. But we have to concede that he is extremely talented.” To make matters worse, Degas had an eye condition identified during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 that made him extremely sensitive to sunlight and resulted in his near-total blindness from 1901.
