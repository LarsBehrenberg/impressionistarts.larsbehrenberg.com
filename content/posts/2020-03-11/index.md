**Claude Monet is probably the most famous impressionist today. If you asked a man on the street to name an impressionist painting he would probably reply “water lilies”.**

Unlike Edouard Manet who died young, Monet lived to the age of 86. That meant he lived to enjoy acclaim and the financial success of his works.

But the road to recognition was anything but smooth: Monet was often rejected by the conservative art establishment; his Impression Sunrise was mocked when the impressionists first exhibited together in 1874; he often lived from hand to mouth and frequently had to beg his friends and supporters for money; his first wife, Camille Doncieux, died aged 32, leaving him with two young sons to care for; he almost died when he was swept into the sea trying to finish a painting; and he once even tried to commit suicide.

Thank goodness he did not succeed. Monet may have been the best painter of light—perhaps the best painter—the world has ever seen: he produced sparkling seascapes, modern scenes (such as the Gare Saint-Lazare) and pictures of the Seine and Venice; he produced glimmering water lilies; and he produced collections of the same subject at different times of day—including Haystacks, Poplars, Rouen Cathedral, and the Houses of Parliament.

Monet's art now sells for tens of millions of dollars (for example, a version of Haystacks sold in May 2019 for $110.7 million). He is rightly regarded as the greatest of the impressionists.

Monet was born into a humble Parisian household on 18 November 1840, the second son of a shopkeeper.

### Monet's childhood
When he was six, Monet's parents decided to move to Le Havre so that his father could join his brother-in-law’s chandler's business. The move suited Monet: he loved roaming the beaches and cliffs, often playing truant from school.

He also had an early talent for art, or rather caricature. Starting with sketches of school friends and teachers, he was soon poking fun at local celebrities and selling his works for between 10 and 20 francs a go at the local picture framer's shop. Our first picture is of one of his caricatures, always signed Oscar (Claude-Oscar was Monet's first name).

### Boudin
It was at the picture framer's that Monet met Eugene Boudin, a landscapist who painted en plein air (outdoors). This was a recent phenomenon, made possible by paint becoming available in metal tubes. It was also looked down on by the art establishment, who thought that sketches should be made outside and paintings produced in studios.

Boudin took the young Monet under his wing and showed him how to paint. Monet was later to say:

“if I became a painter, it was thanks to Boudin. He was a man of infinite kindness and took it upon himself to teach me.”

Although Monet’s father disapproved, he did not stand in the way when his maternal aunt produced a letter of introduction to one of her painter contacts in Paris. This soon led to Monet turning up at Suisse’s painting studio in 1859, where he met Camille Pissarro (1830-1903).

### Paris, the army, back to Le Havre and Jongkind
In 1860, Monet was conscripted into the army. He opted to serve in Algeria but promptly caught typhoid fever. He came back to Le Havre to recuperate and his family bought him out of the army.

It was at this stage that Monet met Johan Jongkind, a Dutch landscapist. Jongkind taught Monet how to appreciate light, with Monet later describing him as his “true master” and the person who “completed the education of my eye”.

But Jongkind was a notorious drunk and womaniser and Monet’s family did not approve of his new friend. This was the main reason why they were happy for him to go back to Paris on condition that he sought to obtain entry to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts (the respectable but highly conservative fine arts school). They even provided a small allowance.

### Gleyre's studio
Monet ended up in the studio of Charles Gleyre, an idealist painter who was happy to let students develop their own styles. It was here that he met Auguste Renoir, Frederic Bazille and Alfred Sisley.

He also encountered Paul Cezanne, regarded by other students as an oddball.

Monet was a cocky student. Good looking, witty and confident in his abilities, he was popular with the ladies. He once rebuffed an unwanted advance by saying:

“I’m sorry, but I only sleep with duchesses or maids. Anything in between I find revolting. My ideal woman would be a Duchess’ maid!”
On another occasion, Gleyre returned to find Monet on the model’s podium, rearranging the position of the nude female posing for the class.
