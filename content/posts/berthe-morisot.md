**In many ways, Berthe Morisot captured the essence of Impressionism.**

Critics, including Paul Mantz and Theodore Duret, described her as a ‘quintessential Impressionist’. This is evident in the way her works manipulate light and colour, exuding life and a sense of fleeting emotion.

Throughout her life, from 1841-1895, Morisot innovated in her artwork, depicting figures and scenes that were otherwise ignored by many male artists at the time. She experimented with painting ‘en plein air’ (ie outdoors), characteristic of the Impressionist style, but the necessity of having a male chaperone impacted on her ability to paint in open spaces. Nevertheless, to reduce her to the ranks of a female painter focussing solely on feminine life is to ignore the diversity and experimentation in her work.

Born in 1841 in Bourges, France, Morisot grew to become a key figure in the Impressionist art movement without ever being fully recognised as one. She walked a thin line between being an upper-class society woman and a professional painter who could compete with any of her male contemporaries. Her own self-criticism is one reason given for her lack of fame during her life and posthumously. Another is her position as a woman in a world that was firmly male-dominated.

Morisot died suddenly in 1895 having championed the Impressionist movement both financially and in her own works.

In spite of her significant contributions to one of the most important eras of French art, Morisot was never credited with the same successes of many of the male Impressionists she worked with side by side. To this day, she is a relative outsider in the canon of impressionist artists, exhibitions of her work are rare and revisionist scholars fight for her contribution to be recognised.
