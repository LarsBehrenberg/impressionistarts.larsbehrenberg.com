**Edgar Degas was born in Paris in 1834, his father a wealthy banker and his mother an emigre from New Orleans.**

Despite his privileged upbringing, Degas was a difficult person. He was opinionated, demanding and (at least in later life) anti-Semitic. As Caillebotte said during preparations for one of the impressionist exhibitions,

“He is quite intolerable. But we have to concede that he is extremely talented.”
To make matters worse, Degas had an eye condition identified during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 that made him extremely sensitive to sunlight and resulted in his near-total blindness from 1901.

But Degas was indeed a genius. He focused on classical technique in the early years of his career, though his famous work from this era Spartan Girls Challenging Boys has a number of modern touches. Degas also exhibited in seven of the eight impressionist exhibitions, more than many of the key impressionists such as Manet, Monet, Cezanne and Renoir.

Today he is best known for his works of ballerinas and jockeys. His works of the ballet are particularly striking: they are incredibly beautiful, they are unusual (often painted from unusual angles), and they also depict the reality of the lives lived by working class dancers—rehearsal, exhaustion, exploitation.

Degas is also rightly famous for a number of works of the New Orleans cotton exchange run by his mother’s family, which he visited in the early 1870s.

Edgar Degas was born on 19 July 1834 at 8, Rue Saint Georges in Paris. He was the eldest of his parents' five children Degas’ father, Augustin, was a wealthy banker and his mother a Creole emigre from New Orleans. Degas attended a good Lycee and graduated with a baccalaureate in 1853. He then studied law for a while, but it became increasingly clear that art was his true vocation.

Unlike Monet, Degas’ father was a source of encouragement and advice. Degas enrolled at the Louvre as a copyist and spent large chunks of the 1850s in Italy, staying in Florence and Rome in particular, copying Renaissance masterpieces.

### Degas’ early style

Degas’ early style might be said to be classical, and it is certainly true that he was inspired by Ingres and old masters such as Titian. But two aspects of Degas’ work suggested from an early age that he was destined for greatness.

First, Degas was a hard-worker. By 1860, he has produced 700 copies of older works.

Secondly, and more importantly, Degas did not copy works unthinkingly. He would, for example, focus on a small part of a masterpiece rather than seek to reproduce the whole. And Degas committed his thinking on painting, together with many of his innermost thoughts, to a meticulous diary.

### Degas’ early works
Degas’ unique insight can be seen in three of his earliest works, The Suffering of New Orleans, Spartan Girls Challenging Boys and The Bellelli Family.

(1) The Suffering of New Orleans is ostensibly an historical painting in classical style. But it seeks to depict a modern event, the capture of New Orleans by Union Troops in 1862 (representing a major turning-point in the American Civil War).
