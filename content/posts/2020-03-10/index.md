**Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born in 1842 in Limoges, southern France.**

Unlike Manet and Degas, who came from wealthy families, Renoir was the son of a tailor and a seamstress and was set to work at a porcelain factory at the age of 13.

His natural talent for painting was soon obvious: he could paint beautiful motifs far faster than anyone else. Renoir enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and had a triumphant decade of producing the most exquisite impressionist works between 1874 and 1883. Those works can be summarised in one word: 'joy'.


## Renoir's early years

Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born on 25 February 1841 in Limoges, the sixth of seven children.

His father, Leonard, was a tailor; his mother a seamstress. One of Renoir’s earliest memories was watching his father sitting cross-legged on the floor surrounded by cloth, scissors, patterns and velvet pincushions. He also regularly drew on the floor with his father’s chalk.

Paris and porcelain
Renoir and his family moved to Paris when Renoir was three, his father seeking to enhance his prospects. After seven years in a catholic primary school, aged just 13, Renoir became an apprentice porcelain painter.

Renoir’s work involved painting flowers, pastoral scenes and even the portrait of Marie Antoinette onto cups, vases and plates. He excelled and developed a love of the bright luminous painting for which he was to become famous.

### Interesting fact
Renoir obviously had a prodigious natural talent, and was able to paint far quicker than his fellow artisans (who named him Monsieur Rubens). This meant that he earned good money, for he was paid by the piece, and he was able to help his parents buy a little cottage in Louveciennes.


Renoir took evening classes in painting and often spent his lunch hour sketching at the Louvre. But this happy life was halted by the industrial revolution: a machine was invented to print pictures onto china and he and his colleagues were made redundant. He therefore turned to painting fans and banners.

Renoir studies art
By the age of 21, Renoir has saved enough to further his further studies.

He enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts (though this was short-loved as he didn’t enjoy its rigid syllabus) and took evening courses at Gleyre’s studio. It was here that he met Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley and Frederic Bazille.

Not that Renoir always got on with Gleyre. On one occasion, Gleyre said to Renoir “Young man, you are very skilful, but it looks like you only paint for your own enjoyment”, to which Renoir replied

“well yes, if I didn’t enjoy it I wouldn’t be doing it”.
Unlike many of the other impressionists, Renoir was easy-going and tolerant. He was not trying to be disrespectful. He just had a passion for painting.
