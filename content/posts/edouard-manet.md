      This is the body text!**Edouard Manet in 1846, aged 14.**


      Manet studied in the studio of Thomas Couture between 1850 and 1856.


      Manet's first submission to the conservative Salon of the Academy des
      Beaux Arts was the Absinthe Drinker.  It did not find favour. Manet was
      not academic: at school he achieved average grades in everything except
      art and gymnastics.


      This displeased his father, who wanted his eldest son to follow him into
      the law.


      Manet’s artistic desires were instead encouraged by his mother, with whom
      he was very close, and his maternal uncle, Édmond Fournier (who often took
      Manet and his best friend, Antonin Proust, to the Louvre).


      ### The navy?


      Manet’s refusal to study law led to arguments with his father and,
      eventually, a compromise by which it was agreed that Manet would become a
      naval officer.


      But the 16 year-old Manet failed the exams and ended up on a merchant
      ship, called Havre et Guadeloupe, bound for Rio de Janeiro (8 December
      1848 to 13 June 1849). The idea was that Manet would study for his re-sits
      on board.

       Interesting fact ... The crossing was eventful. Manet was tossed around the ship during storms; spent days watching the water and the clouds; engaged in a maritime ritual for sailors passing the equator for the first time; went to the Rio carnival; was bitten by a snake; drew caricatures (which the ship's captain used as Christmas presents); and gave the crew painting lessons. He also resolved not to be a sailor.

      On his return, Manet duly failed his re-sits and was eventually allowed to
      enrol in a painting school run by the classical landscapist Thomas
      Couture.

**Edouard Manet was born in 1832, the first child of Auguste and Eugenie.**

He was, unlike many of the other impressionists, born into a wealthy bourgeois family: his father a senior civil servant and later a judge; his mother the goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince.

Manet’s roots were a blessing and a burden: he did not have to worry about money, being left a substantial inheritance on his father’s death in 1862, and so could paint his way without having to worry about sales. But his desire to please his father and justify his career choice after his father’s death meant that he never stopped trying to impress the conservative art establishment—with only limited success.
